It was founded in July 2016 as a Swiss company called <a target =""_blank"" href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/melonport/company_financials"">Melonport AG</a>, successfully ICO'd its MLN trading token in March 2017, and has since integrated multiple tokens and tooling. In early 2019, Melonport self-dissolved and handed authority of the protocol over to the Melon Council. The project rebranded to Enzyme in Dec. 2020, while sticking with $MLN.</p> 
      <p><br>Enzyme's two Council DAOs, ""Melon Council"" and ""Enzyme Council"", are actually one and the same institution evolved over time, and the governor of the Enzyme project on Web3. It is mandated to nurture and guard the protocol, its products and ecosystem.</p>
      <p><br>Thus, the (Aragon-based) Melon Council DAO, of founders and early business partners, had served as Melon's governor up until rebranding. It was smoothly inherited by the (currently Snapshot) Enzyme Council DAO, with 6 of the 9 original member addresses still serving, as does MGM - one of the Council's 2 original governance tokens.</p>
      <p><br>The Council is ""bound by fiduciary duties, guiding principles and Enzyme Council Statutes"" (from <a target =""_blank"" href=""https://docs.enzyme.finance/governance/enzyme-technical-council"">documentation</a>). It currently operates through a number of specialized teams who come under either the Enzyme Technical Council or the Enzyme User Representatives group.
